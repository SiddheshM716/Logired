The "Harry Potter" series, written by J.K. Rowling, follows the life and adventures of a young wizard named
Harry Potter. The story begins with Harry discovering on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard and has
been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends such as Ron Weasley
and Hermione Granger and learns about his past, including the fact that he survived a curse from the dark wizard
Lord Voldemort as an infant.

Over the course of seven books, the series explores Harry's growth, his battles against dark forces, and his quest
to stop Voldemort from achieving immortality and dominating the wizarding world. Each book corresponds to a school
year, with the overarching narrative culminating in a final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort.

Themes of friendship, bravery, loyalty, and the triumph of good over evil are woven throughout the series. The
"Harry Potter" books have become immensely popular worldwide and are acclaimed for their imaginative storytelling,
well-developed characters, and their ability to resonate with readers of all ages.
